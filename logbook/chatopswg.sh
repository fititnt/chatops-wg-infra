############################# **Security warning** #############################
# This VM is designed for testing and be friendly even for who is new to docker
# at least start project without care much about running docker on production.
# And the lifetime of this VM will be less than 6 months. And, by other factors
# than just security, will have some regular backups or easy to be regenerated.
# This explain why docker will be running as root, which is less secure, because
# is faster to avoid extra steps and a a lot of time-consuming debugging. PRs
# and issues on GitHub page are wellcome, in special if some configuration
# on this infrastructure could easily exploited by automated tools, but just
# consider that some even less secure use on the containers, like explicit open
# ports or admin panels, are not just because is a testing envoriment, but
# to make it more frienly to non devops people.
#
# For running docker on production or with more sensive data, consider
# this documentation at https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/
